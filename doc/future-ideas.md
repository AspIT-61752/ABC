# Future Ideas

## Easy

- Custom names. The site says hello _name_ when you login. So the ID and the display name isn't the same thing, the ID stays the same.

## Medium

- Store data in DB as json or an array of objects
- Settings (Language, currency, etc.)

## Hard

- Import and Export to a file format like .csv
