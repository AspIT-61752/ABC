## Problem Statement

### A free, easy to use website to create and manage your budget

In todays society, there's a lot of paid services, that a lot of people can't afford. They live paycheck to paycheck, and could benefit from a simple, easy to use solution. The average debt in the US is currently about \$104,249 (August 13th, 2024) and in 2020 it was "only" \$91k. That's why people need a tool to help them payback their debts, and still have money to save up for education for a bright and more prosperous future in America, an America with less social inequality. ðŸ¦…
